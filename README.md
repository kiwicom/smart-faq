## Translations

- Check out [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) and [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) docs for more info.
- [DOCs for Phraseapp](https://phraseapp.com/docs/) - where the translations are stored for translators
- List of all supported languages is defined by file `i18n/languages.js`

### How to contribute

#### Translations

- be declarative & use `Trans` component whenever it's possible: 
```
<Trans i18nKey="translation_key">
    Hello <strong title={t('nameTitle')}>{{name}}</strong>, you have {{count}} unread message. <Link to="/msgs">Go to messages</Link>.
</Trans>
```
- use `i18n.t` function only when `Trans` can't be used

#### Before you are done

- run `yarn translations:collect` to recollect all translations for all supported languages
- provide translations for all keys with `__STRING_NOT_TRANSLATED__` as value

### Build process

#### Github Pages

- After every merge into master, standalone version of this project is published using Github Pages 
- Inspired by repository [Circle CI and Github Pages](https://github.com/Villanuevand/deployment-circleci-gh-pages) and further described on [Github](https://github.com/DevProgress/onboarding/wiki/Using-Circle-CI-with-Github-Pages-for-Continuous-Delivery)

### TO RE-FACTOR (when Orbit is ready)
- `Button`s at Intro page need to have bold text
- `Need help?` needs to be re-factor to use the `Text` component from Orbit(currenty it's hardcoded CSS)
- At `IntroPage`: replace the `history.push` onChange trigger with `Button` using a children of type `Link`(already merged in Orbit master but not published yet)
